### What is Reflow Soldering?
Reflow soldering is a process in which a solder paste (a sticky mixture of powdered solder and flux) is used to temporarily attach one or thousands of tiny electrical components to their contact pads, after which the entire assembly is subjected to controlled heat. The solder paste reflows in a molten state, creating permanent solder joints. Heating may be accomplished by passing the assembly through a reflow oven.

### Reflow Curve
The reflow curve of the temperature of a certain point on the SMA with time when the SMA passes through the reflow oven furnace. The temperature curve provides an intuitive method to analyze the temperature change of a component during the entire reflow soldering process.
Below is the proper reflow curve a heater should achieve for perfect soldering of components.

The hOtpLaTe r0.1 manages to acheive this temperature curve by adjusting the switching duty of MOSFET which results in variation in heat.
The temperature sensor continously reads the temperatures and sends back to the Microcontroller.
